    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>6 chicken drumsticks</li>
      <li>2 eggs <em>(for egg wash)</em></li>
      <li>1/2 cup of flour</li>
      <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp onion powder</li>
      <li>4 tsp smoked paprika</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Step 1</em>: Using a dutch oven, or another large pot, fill the pot
        about half way with oil and begin heating the oil to around 375 degrees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Step 2</em>: Lay out your chicken on a baking sheet or cutting
        board. Season genrerously with salt and pepper on all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Step 3</em>: Mix together the flour and dry seasongings to create
        your dredge. Add salt and pepper to taste here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Step 4</em>: Whisk your eggs in a bowl with a small splash of milk
        or water to make your egg wash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Step 5</em>: Begin dredging your chicken. Take a piece and roll it
        in the seasoned flour, followed by the egg wash, then once more in the
        flour and into the hot oil. This creates a nice cruchy outer layer that
        is full of favor. Repeat with all of your chicken.
